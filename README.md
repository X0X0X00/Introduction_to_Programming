# CSC 161 Introduction to Programming
Organized thinking, creative problem solving, and the precise description of
solutions are valuable skills in academia and life. The formulation and
solution of problems using computers is increasingly important in all artistic
and scholarly fields. We introduce core concepts and techniques of
programming as a way to develop these skills, as basis for further CS study,
and for application to other fields. Lab required. This course has no
prerequisites.
